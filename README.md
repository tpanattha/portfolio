# Panattha Chumklang - Data Analysis Portfolio
Hi, I'm Taew I like data analytics and the use of various technologies to be fascinating. I started my independent studies as a result to carry on with my data analytics work.
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Table of contents
- [Portfolio Projects](#portfolio-projects)
- [Certificates](#certificates)

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job done but sometimes certificates appear to be as an indirect result:) So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):
- [Introduction to SQL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14wufEG1gil0ZzoJL6RjT9CuHSNZP5U_2/view?usp=share_link) (Oct 2022) (DataCamp)
- [Citical Thinking for Besiness](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TK8j5x_fOKWIgsCfpPC3q2YBBQYw7Mk9/view?usp=sharing) (Jul 2022) (CHULA MOOC)
